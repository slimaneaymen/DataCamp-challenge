The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for the next move of a tennis player, i.e. Novak Djokovic, by analyzing his past movements and interactions with his opponent. The project likely involves collecting and analyzing data on Djokovic's previous matches, including his movements on the court, his shots, and his tactics, as well as the movements and tactics of his opponents. This data will then be used to develop a predictive model that can analyze current match situations and predict the most likely next move for the player (i.e. Djokovic) based on his past patterns and tendencies. 
In this project we used machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis techniques to analyze and model the data. 
The results of this project could be used to improve tennis training and strategy, as well as to enhance the viewing experience for fans by providing more detailed insights into the strategies and tactics of elite players.
